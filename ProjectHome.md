<p>This program is designed for USB device safe removal.</p>
<p>The main restriction of Windows standard flash drive remover is that it doesn't show the reason of device blocking - opened files and directories situated on the removable drive. There are several solutions of this problem, and one of them - USB Safely Remove - copes with this successfully. Unfortunately, USB Safely Remove is not a freeware program. Due to this, I decided to write my own freeware program that has all the basic functions of USB Safely Remove - find, kill and eject :)</p>
<p>This project was started as a task on a programming course at the university. Now it's really quite interesting to develop it and to find something new for yourself</p>
<p>If you have some interesting ideas about how to improve this project, please, contact me. I'll be glad to listen to you. Also you may ask your questions and send your interesting ideas to my email DarthYarius_0990@mail.ru</p>
<br>
<p>P.S. I'm searching for people who<br>
<ul>
<li>would like to test USBRemover with cardreaders</li>
<li>would like to participate in development (it's really difficult to do everything alone)</li>
<li>would like to write the documentation :) (I cannot do this because of lack of time; also I doubt if my English is quite good for writing documentation)</li>
</ul>
